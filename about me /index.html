    Hi i am Shiva born and raised in Nepal. I studied   BSc microbiology  at Tribhuvan University, kathmandu Nepal. Since 2016 i started living in Netherland. Few years i worked in the field oc care ( Zorg) as a part time  most of the time and few months as a full time.  I came to  study IT at Inholland  because  the courses and the resources are in english language  more than that i really enjoy working with computers. <br> <br>

    my hobbies includes troubleshooting and modyfying the computers. Specially used in gamings ( i donâ€™t play computer game myself though).  Other than this i  like to engaged in various aativities hosted in the neighbourhood. I play football , go swimming in the lake nearby which makes me happy and in the same time also makes bonding with the  other people who have similar interest. <br> <br>

    Overall , i tried to make balance between my academic career, love for the technology  and the outdoor activities. Mixture of these all interest keeps me being motivated, engaged and living the fullest of my personal life.
